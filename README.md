# AmazonGiveaway_Crawler

Selenium example:

doesn't function with the animated dropping boxes, possibly because focus needs to be maintained? If I enter the contest manually, I need to maintain the window with the bouncing box as my main window in order for the animation to complete.

I'm not sure if I'll stick with Selenium or not, eventually I'd like to create a web front end that anyone can use to automate giveaway entries for categories/requirement they're interested in.
