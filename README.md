# AmazonGiveaway_Crawler

Selenium example (404 error): 
http://mattharris.org/2016/11/28/automating-amazon-giveaways/

This example doesn't function with the animated dropping boxes. Possibly because focus needs to be maintained? If I enter the contest manually, I need to keep the window with the bouncing box as my main window and active in order for the animation to complete which enables to click event.

Another example: https://github.com/zdrouse/Auto-Amazon-Giveaways

Looks like the same potential issue with the bounce box? I didn't see that in the code, just no req, twitter follow, twitter retweet

I'm not sure if I'll stick with Selenium or not, eventually I'd like to create a web front end that anyone can use to automate giveaway entries for categories/requirement they're interested in.
